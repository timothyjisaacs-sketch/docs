## Strategy #1: User Group

Mintlify is a product that’s bought, not sold. Let’s deepen that natural momentum by building out or bolstering an organic user group. A word of caution: user groups can feel “corporate,” in the most pejorative sense, so it's important to maintain authenticity. 

To get there, we sponsor it, but customers run it. Our goal should be to create a channel to share information, not to sell. If done right, we will have planted the seeds for a marketing exostructure outside the company, at very low cost. It's a win-win, because customers get exposure, too.

We start by supplying customer-mods with ten topics that have gotten others especially excited, and assign team members to respond to queries. We review traction 30 days in, and adjust from there. 

## Strategy #2: Build in Public


An organic marketing campaign where we bring your creed to life by emphasizing how we sweat the details. It’s not so much feature-focused, as it is advertising the importance of craft in building a documentation platform ready for the future. 

We can have ten high quality assets up in a month's time across multiple channels, like social posts from team members on LinkedIn and Twitter.

A note: we shouldn't mindlessly generate content at volume. Good posts on our process will eventually resonate. Marty from Pylon has some great posts, as a reference.

## Strategy #3: Ask the Team

The best idea is probably one I haven't had yet. It's a vestige of something old in the back of somebody's head, or a nascent, undeveloped thought that has yet to come to the fore. How do we get to it? Design thinking.

In a nutshell: 
            1. Release all binding constraints, and sit with a white board until there’s 50 ideas on it. "Fly the Mintlify team to the moon." But get 50 ideas up.
            2. Sleep on it.
            3. Pick the best “normal” one, and the best “crazy” one, and build a prototype for each. Test, and see what sticks. 

Never know what might come of it, and buy-in from including others is worth its weight in gold.
