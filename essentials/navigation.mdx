### No Customer Advisory Board
For some, wise; at this size, we’re not ready.

### No AI Slop
Low-quality content cheapens the brand, and developers will hate it.

### No Google Adwords
Some investment is shrewd, but be wary of diminishing returns.

### No Paid PR Placement
Coinbase tells me you don’t need it.

### No Analyst Endorsements
Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are pay to play. With PLG, you want to lead the conversation anyway. You’ll know you’ve won when they come asking for you.
