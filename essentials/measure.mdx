### 1. Unique Monthly Visitors (UMV)

Measure of the website's reach, counting each user only once regardless of how many times they access the site within that month. 

### 2. Page Views

Internet user visiting thought leadership assets we develop in campaigns.

### 3. Click-Thru Rate (CTR)

A measure of the effectiveness of authentic thought leadership in driving real leads.

### 4. Less Common: Qualitative Engagement

We ask the team to report on how many truly interesting conversations they’ve had on a novel product feature. 

How many interesting coversations over all mediums? (Customer calls, LinkedIn, house parties, literally any channel, anywhere). We ask again on day 60. It’s not exact, but it’s a way of measuring buzz by relying on the human intuition of the team.
