## Observations

#### Mintlify is a company with a creed. 

What does that mean? You have a strong brand identity, and you live up to it. Apple and Linear are examples of companies that operate off a central creed, too. Apple’s founding principle was to marry technology and beauty, designing the inside just as elegantly as the outside. These companies think not in terms of “this is what we do," but rather in terms of, “this is who we are.” Linear has built a brand identity in a similar vein: “This is the right way to do things, and we’re not afraid to say so.”

#### What is Mintlify's creed? 

A chef once told me: "Do the right thing, *especially* when no one is looking." That's Mintlify, to me. In a restaurant, you trust that the food you're eating has been handled with great care. It's no different for software. Developers who are migrating a help center, for example, will be far more likely to buy if they feel you have pride in your craft. If they can trust that you will do it right, even when they’re not looking, the rest is just details.

#### How does the creed inform marketing strategy? 

You've earned the respect of your ICP. As a result, your product has a remarkable, rare attribute: it is bought, not sold. Marketing a product like this takes a special approach. You need to tell the story of your commitment to craft. You need to amplify customer narratives that show how you live up to your creed, not just how you create value or solve problems. 

#### What's the challenge?
 
It is likely that, as you grow and mature, stakeholders will pressure you to adopt traditional SaaS marketing strategies. Staying authentic through growth will take, above all, steady hands at the helm on the product side. On the marketing side, though, you'll need someone with an innate ability to craft your "voice." That knack for turning a phrase, for distilling things down and iterating until the words fall just right, is my strength.

## Questions

#### What instrumentation systems do you have? 

Salesforce, HubSpot? How do you track leads, and what degree of confidence do you have in that data? What leading indicators do you rely on to predict future growth?

#### What's your growth plan?

What is the cohort of customers you are serving now? How do you plan to expand mid-market?

#### Learnings from failure.

I’ve learned more from failure than I have from success. Can you share a couple customer stories of prized accounts that have churned? What went wrong? What did you learn?

#### To AI or not to AI...

What's your opinion on AI-generated content? To what extent do you expect the marketing org to leverage it? I can adjust to team expectations, but generally default to "brainwriting" for high-order tasks like business strategy, and more AI use for lower-order work.

#### What's the experience of the sales org?

Where are sales people spending their time during the pre-sale process? What resonates most with ICP? What topics are customer support folks/forward deployed engineering teams spending their time educating people?
